          “Trust in the Lord with all your heart; do not rely on your own understanding.” — Proverbs 3:5
        </blockquote>

        <div class="explain" id="verseExplain">
          <p>
            Proverbs 3:5–6 is God’s quiet reminder that you don’t have to hold every piece of life together by yourself. “Trust in the Lord with all your heart” means letting Him carry the places in you that feel stretched, exhausted, or unsure, knowing He understands the weight you’re under even when no one else sees it. “Lean not on your own understanding” is His way of softly telling you that you don’t need to figure everything out — your perspective is shaped by the battles you’ve survived, but His is shaped by the future He’s preparing for you. And when you acknowledge Him in every part of your life, even the small everyday moments, you allow Him to guide you with a tenderness that never forces and never fails. His promise is simple and beautiful: He will direct your path, gently, intentionally, and with a love that refuses to let your sacrifices go unnoticed or your future go unprotected.

           Even when the world feels heavy and the weight of responsibility presses on your shoulders, God sees every fight you face. He knows the nights you’ve cried Alone, the moments you felt too tired to keep going, and the sacrifices no one noticed. He is not distant, He is holding you, strengthening your heart, and guiding your steps. Your courage matters more than you know, your dreams are sacred, and your life is woven with purpose by His hand. Today, lean into Him fully. Let Him carry what you cannot. And remember: you are never alone, your tears are not wasted, and every step you take is leading to a future only He can create
